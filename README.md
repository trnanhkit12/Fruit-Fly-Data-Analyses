# Fruit Flies Connectome Analysis

## About

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks developed by Kiet Tran as part of a research project analyzing the connectome of fruit flies. These notebooks were primarily created as a tool for personal learning and experimental analysis. 

### Key Points

- **Maintenance**: The code in this repository was not originally intended for reuse; therefore, it has not been maintained or tidied up for public use. Users may find the code and comments as-is from the original experiments.
  
- **Learning Journey**: The organization of the notebooks might appear incoherent as each represents a different stage in my experimental learning process throughout the research.

- **Content**: Most notebooks primarily document the results of various analyses performed as the research progressed. They serve as a chronological record of my findings and hypotheses testing.
